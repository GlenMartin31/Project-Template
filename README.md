# Project Template

This repository is intended to use as a demo about how I organize my research projects. This structure of files and organisation helps keep things in a consistent format across projects, and it intended to make things automated as much as possible (e.g. using rmarkdown for document creation). This also makes use of version control through git and github. 

# Folder Structure
In all projects, I like to follow the following structure:
  
- `Data`: this folder is used to hold raw data and processed data. This contains subfolders for each of raw data and processed data.
- `Scripts`: this folder holds all coding scripts (e.g. R scripts or SQL scripts).
- `Manuscript`: saves the rmarkdown files and/or documents for publication of manuscripts. This is also where I save any figures/tables/output generated from R codes.
- `Templates`: this folder contains templates (e.g. for rmarkdown) that are useful to repeat across projects.
